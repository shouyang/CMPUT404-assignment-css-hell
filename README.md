Part 1
=================
I styled the pages in the form of an streotypical old-cursive manuscript as per Hindle's suggestion.

Changes in "gutenberg/site.css":
    * Changed paragraphs and other text elements to resemble old cursive writing.
    * Changed headers to be title capped cursive writing.
    * Changed background color to a deeper brownish color called burlywood.
    * Filtered images into greyscale, the images for my texts were in sepia orginally.
    * Styled images similarly to paragraphs.

Note: The preferred font is a windows font called Garamond which is likely not on the lab machines.


Part 2
=================
Please note that for the good version, I couldn't find a suitable wood texture akin to the one used in the oatmeal comic. 

Note: The preferred font is a windows font called Comic Sans which is likely the exact font used in the comic and is likely also not on the lab machines.
